      <p> 2. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS </p>
      <p> 2.1 Digital Rights Management. Content providers are using the digital rights management technology contained in this Software (&quot;DRM&quot;) to protect the integrity of their content ( &quot;Secure Content&quot;) so that their intellectual property, including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated. Portions of this Software and third party applications such as media players use DRM to play Secure Content (&quot;DRM Software&quot;). If the DRM Software's security has been compromised, owners of Secure Content (&quot;Secure Content Owners&quot;) may request that MAX ReadTime revoke the DRM Software's right to copy, display and/or play Secure Content. Revocation does not alter the DRM Software's ability to play unprotected content. A list of revoked DRM Software is sent to your computer whenever you download a license or register for Secure Content from the Internet. You therefore agree that MAX ReadTime may, in conjunction with such license, also download revocation lists onto your computer on behalf of Secure Content Owners. MAX ReadTime will not retrieve any personally identifiable information, or any other information, from your computer by downloading such revocation lists. Secure Content Owners may also require you to upgrade some of the DRM components in this Software (&quot;DRM Upgrades&quot;) before accessing their content. When you attempt to play such content, MAX ReadTime DRM Software will notify you that a DRM Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent before the DRM Upgrade is downloaded. Third party DRM Software may do the same. If you decline the upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the DRM Upgrade; however, you will still be able to access unprotected content and Secure Content that does not require the upgrade. </p>
      <p> 2.2 This EULA does not grant you any rights to use the MAX ReadTime components contained in the Software (PRODUCT) to develop a software application that uses MAX ReadTime technology. If you wish to use the MAX ReadTime Technology to develop such an application, visit http://www.maxreadtime.com, and contact us at cahubley@maxreadtime.com. </p>

      <p> 2.4 Update Features. If you choose to utilize the update features within the Software (PRODUCT), it is necessary to use certain computer system, hardware, and software information to implement the features. By using these features, you explicitly authorize MAX ReadTime or its designated agent to access and utilize the necessary information for Internet updating purposes.

AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE WARRANTY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty or condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you. Any supplements or updates to the Software (PRODUCTS), including without limitation, any (if any) service packs or hot fixes provided to you after the expiration of the Limited Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory. </p>

The terms of Section 17 (&quot;Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages&quot;) are also incorporated into this Limited Warranty. Some provinces/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. This Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights which vary from state/jurisdiction to provinces/jurisdiction. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.

      <p> MAX ReadTime garantit que le Logiciel fonctionnera conform&eacute;ment aux documents inclus pendant une p&eacute;riode de 90 jours suivant la date de r&eacute;ception. Si une garantie ou condition implicite est cr&eacute;&eacute;e par votre &Eacute;tat ou votre territoire et qu'une loi f&eacute;d&eacute;rale ou provinciale ou &Eacute;tat en interdit le d&eacute;ni, vous jouissez &eacute;galement d'une garantie ou condition implicite, MAIS UNIQUEMENT POUR LES D&Eacute;FAUTS D&Eacute;COUVERTS DURANT LA P&Eacute;RIODE DE LA PR&Eacute;SENTE GARANTIE LIMIT&Eacute;E (QUATRE-VINGT-DIX JOURS). IL N'Y A AUCUNE GARANTIE OU CONDITION DE QUELQUE NATURE QUE CE SOIT QUANT AUX D&Eacute;FAUTS D&Eacute;COUVERTS APR&Egrave;S CETTE P&Eacute;RIODE DE QUATRE-VINGT-DIX JOURS. Certains &Eacute;tats ou territoires ne permettent pas de limiter la dur&eacute;e d'une garantie ou condition implicite de sorte que la limitation ciidessus peut ne pas s'appliquer &agrave; vous. Tous les suppl&eacute;ments ou toutes les mises &agrave; jour relatifs au Logiciel, notamment, les ensembles de services ou les r&eacute;parations &agrave; chaud (le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant) qui vous sont fournis apr&egrave;s l'expiration de la p&eacute;riode de quatre-vingt-dix jours de la garantie limit&eacute;e ne sont pas couverts par quelque garantie ou condition que ce soit, expresse ou implicite. </p>

Certains &Eacute;tats ou territoires ne permettent pas l'exclusion ou la limitation des dommages indirects ou accessoires de sorte que la limitation ou l'exclusion cidessus peut ne pas s'appliquer &agrave; vous. La pr&eacute;sente garantie limit&eacute;e vous donne des droits l&eacute;gaux sp&eacute;cifiques. Vous pouvez avoir d'autres droits qui peuvent varier d'un territoire ou d'un &Eacute;tat &agrave; un autre. VOTRE RECOURS EXCLUSIF. L'obligation int&eacute;grale de MAX ReadTime et de ses fournisseurs et votre recours exclusif seront, selon le choix de MAX ReadTime de temps &agrave; autre sous r&eacute;serve de toute loi applicable, a) le remboursement du prix pay&eacute;, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, pour le Logiciel ou b) la r&eacute;paration ou le remplacement du Logiciel qui ne respecte pas la pr&eacute;sente garantie limit&eacute;e et qui est retourn&eacute; &agrave; MAX ReadTime avec une copie de votre re&ccedil;u. Vous recevrez la compensation choisie par MAX ReadTime, sans frais, sauf que vous &ecirc;tes responsable des d&eacute;penses que vous pourriez engager (p. ex., les frais d'envoi du Logiciel &agrave; MAX ReadTime). La pr&eacute;sente garantie limit&eacute;e est nulle si la d&eacute;fectuosit&eacute; du Logiciel est caus&eacute;e par un accident, un usage abusif, une mauvaise application, un usage anormal ou un virus. Tout Logiciel de remplacement sera garanti pour le reste de la p&eacute;riode de garantie initiale ou pendant trente (30) jours, selon la plus longue entre ces deux p&eacute;riodes. &Agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur des &Eacute;tats-Unis ou du Canada, ces recours ou l'un quelconque des services de soutien technique offerts par MAX ReadTime ne sont pas disponibles sans preuve d'achat d'une source internationale autoris&eacute;e.

La garantie limit&eacute;e mentionn&eacute;e ci-dessus constitue la seule garantie expresse qui vous est donn&eacute;e et remplace toutes autres garanties expresses (s'il en est) mentionn&eacute;es dans un document ou sur un emballage. Sauf en ce qui a trait &agrave; la garantie limit&eacute;e et dans la mesure maximale permise par les lois applicables, le Logiciel et les services de soutien technique (le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant) sont fournis TELS QUELS ET AVEC TOUS LES D&Eacute;FAUTS par MAX ReadTime et ses fournisseurs, lesquels par les pr&eacute;sentes d&eacute;nient toutes autres garanties et conditions expresses, implicites ou en vertu de la loi, notamment (le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant) les garanties, devoirs ou conditions implicites de qualit&eacute; marchande, d'adaptation &agrave; un usage particulier, d'exactitude ou d'exhaustivit&eacute; des r&eacute;ponses, des r&eacute;sultats, des efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s selon les r&egrave;gles de l'art, d'absence de virus et de n&eacute;gligence, le tout &agrave; l'&eacute;gard du Logiciel et de la prestation des services de soutien technique ou de l'omission d'une telle prestation.
