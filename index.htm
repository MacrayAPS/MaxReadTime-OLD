  <p align="left">The interest in books was instilled in me at an early age and I learned to love reading. Fond memories of my Father reading to us at bedtime still stay with me. He gave all eight of us a great advantage in school, as well as provided us with many wonderful hours of reading entertainment. Books allow people young and old to use their imaginations and cognitive skills in a rich, rewarding and informative environment. </p>
